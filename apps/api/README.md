## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Auth API

The API connects to MySQL using `MYSQL_HOST` (defaults to `127.0.0.1`),
`MYSQL_PORT`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, and `MYSQL_DATABASE`. Create the
schema in `apps/community.sql` before starting a new installation. Existing
installations must apply `apps/api/migrations/001_refresh_token_rotation.sql`
before deploying the refresh-token API. Access and refresh tokens are opaque
random credentials; the database stores only their SHA-256 hashes.

`POST /auth/register` accepts `{ "username", "email", "password" }` and returns
HTTP `201`. `POST /auth/login` accepts `{ "identifier", "password" }`, where
`identifier` is a username or email, and returns HTTP `200`. Both return this
response shape:

```json
{
  "accessToken": "opaque-token",
  "tokenType": "Bearer",
  "expiresAt": "2026-10-15T08:15:00.000Z",
  "refreshToken": "opaque-refresh-token",
  "refreshTokenExpiresAt": "2026-11-14T08:00:00.000Z",
  "user": {
    "id": "user-id",
    "username": "sample_user",
    "email": "sample@example.com",
    "createdAt": "2026-10-15T08:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

Access tokens expire after 15 minutes. Send them as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
to authenticated endpoints. `POST /auth/logout` requires this header and returns
HTTP `204`; it revokes that session and its refresh-token family. Registration
requires a 3-50
character username containing only letters, numbers, or underscores, a valid
email, and a 12-128 character password. Validation errors return `400`, duplicate
username/email returns `409`, and invalid login or missing, expired, or revoked
credentials return `401`.

`POST /auth/refresh` accepts `{ "refreshToken": "<refreshToken>" }` and returns
HTTP `200` with the same response shape. Each refresh token can be used only
once; a successful refresh invalidates the previous access and refresh tokens.
Reusing a rotated refresh token revokes the entire session family. Refresh
tokens expire 30 days after session creation; rotation does not extend that
absolute lifetime. `POST /auth/logout` revokes the current session and its
refresh-token family. `POST /auth/logout-all` requires a valid access token and
revokes all sessions belonging to that user. Expired auth-session and
refresh-token records can be purged with periodic database maintenance.

Clients must protect both credentials, never place them in URLs or logs, and
avoid persisting refresh tokens in browser local storage. Browser clients should
keep credentials in memory until an appropriately protected cookie-based flow
is available; native clients should use platform secure storage.

## Public user profiles

`GET /users/:username` returns the public profile for the exact username with
HTTP `200`:

```json
{
  "id": "user-id",
  "username": "sample_user",
  "created_at": "2026-10-15T08:00:00.000Z"
}
```

The response includes only `id`, `username`, and `created_at`; it does not expose
the user's email, password, or password hash. If the username does not exist,
the endpoint returns HTTP `404`:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 404,
  "message": "User not found",
  "error": "Not Found"
}
```

## Communities

`GET /communities` returns a page of communities in a stable order
(`created_at` descending, then `id` descending). It accepts:

- `search`: optional, up to 100 characters; case-insensitive substring match
  against the community name and description.
- `page`: optional, one-based page number (default `1`).
- `limit`: optional page size from `1` to `100` (default `20`).

The response contains `items`, `page`, `limit`, and the matching `total`. An
empty result is returned as HTTP `200` with an empty `items` array.

`POST /communities` requires a bearer token and accepts a `name` (1-50
characters), plus optional `description` and `rules` (up to 16,383 characters
each, keeping values within MySQL's `TEXT` limit with UTF-8 storage). The creator
is taken from the authenticated user, never from the request
body. A duplicate name returns `409`; invalid input returns `400`.
`GET /communities/:name` retrieves a community by its exact name and returns
`404` if it does not exist.

All community endpoints return the same community DTO:

```json
{
  "id": "community-id",
  "creator_id": "user-id",
  "name": "sample",
  "description": null,
  "rules": null,
  "created_at": "2026-10-22T08:00:00.000Z"
}
```

`POST /communities/:name/subscribe` subscribes the authenticated user to the
community. `DELETE /communities/:name/subscribe` removes that user's
subscription. Both require a bearer token, resolve the community by its exact
name, and return HTTP `204` with no response body on success. Repeating either
operation is safe: subscribing twice leaves one subscription, and unsubscribing
when no subscription exists still returns `204`. An unknown community returns
`404`.

## Posts

`GET /posts` is public and returns `{ "items", "page", "limit", "total",
"sort" }`. It accepts optional `community_id`, one-based `page` (default `1`),
`limit` from `1` to `100` (default `20`), and `sort=new` (the only supported
sort order). Posts are ordered by `created_at` descending, then `id` descending
to keep pagination stable. An empty page is returned with HTTP `200`.

`POST /posts` requires a bearer token and accepts `title` (1-300 characters),
`type` (`text`, `link`, or `media`), non-empty `content` (up to 16,383
characters), and an existing `community_id`. For `text`, content is the post
body. For `link` and `media`, content must be an HTTP or HTTPS URL. The author
is always taken from the authenticated user; body-supplied `author_id` is
rejected. Successful creation returns HTTP `201` and the post DTO.

`GET /posts/:id` is public and returns the post DTO, or `404` for an unknown ID.
`DELETE /posts/:id` requires a bearer token and deletes only the authenticated
author's post. It returns HTTP `204` with no body; a post owned by another user
returns `403`, and an unknown post returns `404`. The database cascades deletion
to the post's comments.

Post responses use this DTO:

```json
{
  "id": "post-id",
  "title": "A post",
  "content": "Post body",
  "type": "text",
  "author_id": "user-id",
  "community_id": "community-id",
  "created_at": "2026-10-22T08:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Comments

`GET /posts/:postId/comments` is public and returns
`{ "post_id", "comments" }`. Comments are nested recursively through `replies`;
each comment contains its `id`, `post_id`, `author_id`, `parent_id`, `content`,
`created_at`, and `replies`. Roots and sibling replies use chronological order
(`created_at` ascending, then `id` ascending), making the thread order stable.
An unknown post returns `404`.

`POST /posts/:postId/comments` requires a bearer token and accepts non-empty
`content` (1-16,383 characters) and an optional `parent_id`. The author is
always taken from the authenticated user. The post must exist, and a supplied
parent must belong to that same post; an unknown or cross-post parent returns
`404`. A successful creation returns HTTP `201` and the created comment DTO
with an empty `replies` array.

`DELETE /comments/:id` requires authentication and deletes only the author's
comment. Success returns HTTP `204` with no body; another user's comment
returns `403`, and an unknown comment returns `404`. Deleting a comment also
deletes all descendant replies because the comments table uses
`ON DELETE CASCADE` for `parent_id`.

## Votes

`POST /votes` requires a bearer token and accepts `target_type` (`post` or
`comment`), `target_id`, and `value` (`1` or `-1`). The voter ID always comes
from the authenticated user. Invalid input returns `400`; an unknown target
returns `404`.

The endpoint creates the user's vote or updates its value when a vote already
exists for that user and target. The database's `unique_user_target` constraint
enforces one vote per user and target, including concurrent requests. The
target is locked during the transaction so the response includes the stored
vote and the score recalculated from all votes for that target.

Success returns HTTP `201`:

```json
{
  "id": "vote-id",
  "user_id": "user-id",
  "target_type": "post",
  "target_id": "post-id",
  "value": 1,
  "created_at": "2026-10-22T08:00:00.000Z",
  "score": 3
}
```
